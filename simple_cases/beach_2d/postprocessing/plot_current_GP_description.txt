11, 12, or 13.      Initializes the directory where the output files for this particular simple case are

18.                 creates m and n from the shape of the eta file (n -> Nglob from the input file & m -> Mglob from the input file)
19.                 initializes dx 
20.                 initializes dy

23.                 creates x as a 1D array from m 
24.                 creates y as a 1D array from n

26.                 creates spongeX (related to the Sponge Layer input variables)
27.                 creates spongeY (related to the Sponge Layer input variables)

29.                 creates wavemakerX (related to the Wavemaker Layer input variables)
30.                 creates wavemakerY (related to the Wavemaker Layer input variables)

32.                 indicates which eta output files to test
33.                 for each file, it indicates the minimum time you want the plot to take

36.                 indicates the figure width hyperparameter
37.                 indicates the figure length hyperparameter
40.                 initializes the figure with these hyperparameters

for every subplot
49.                 initialize u as a matrix (probably related to U, Umax, & Umean)
50.                 initialize v as a matrix (probability related to V, VORmax, and Vmax)
51.                 initialize ht as a matrix (related to )
52.                 initialize mask as a matrix

55.                 duplicate and mask u, v, and ht by hiding zeros in them via the mask matrix
56.                 duplicate and mask v by hiding zeros in them via the mask matrix
57.                 duplicate and mask ht by hiding zeros in them via the mask matrix
68.                 creates and adding a new suplot
69.                 separates subplots with hspace = 1.00 wspace = 0.25
70.                 gives the suplot the coolwarm background based on the ht_masked matrix
72.                 initializes the subplot title which is "Time = <time> sec" where time is the subplot's corresponding minimum time in seconds
73.                 applies the title to the subplot
74.                 holds the subplot (depreciated and commented out)
76.                 sets the local variable stride to 8 which I'll later change into a global variable***
79.                 sets up the quivers
81-82.              plots the quiver key which indicates the speed based on a quiver's magnetude     
85.                 plots the rectangular area of the sponge
86.                 gives the sponge's area the name "Sponge" and give it the color green
88.                 plots the rectangular area of the wavemaker
89.                 gives the wavemaker's area the name "Wakemaker" and give it the color "k"
92.                 initializes the Y axis in meters if the current sublot is the first
93.                 initializes the X axis in meters if the current sublot is the first
95.                 initializes the X axis in meters if the current sublot is not the first
96.                 initializes the sublot's colorbar if the current sublot is not the first
97.                 changes the sublot's colorbar's label to "Hsig (m)" and rotates it 90 degrees

99-103.             executes the algorithm to create all subplots

106.                publishes the main figure
