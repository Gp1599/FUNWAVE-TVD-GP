40.                 initializes the main figure using these hyperparameters along with the dpi value

for every subplot
46.                 initializes the subplot's file number

58.                 initializes fnum to be used to help read eta's filename
59.                 extracts the eta data from the current eta file
60.                 extracts mask data from the current eta file
